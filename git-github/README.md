# Git and Github Introduction

## Description
This workshop will serve as an introduction to [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and **GitHub**. Git operates largely as a version control system that tracks changes in your code -- this code (or set of codes) can then be hosted on GitHub, an online platform that is widely used to collaborate on open-source projects and review code, among other things.
