# Git and Github Introduction
This workshop is based on materials by [Software Carpentry](https://www.software-carpentry.org/)

## Description
This workshop will serve as an introduction to **Git** and **GitHub**. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) largely operates as a version control system that tracks changes in your code -- this code (or set of codes) can then be hosted on GitHub, an online platform that is widely used to store/review code and collaborate on open-source projects, among other things.
## To-do before the workshop
1. Make sure your [web browser](https://help.github.com/en/articles/supported-browsers) is supported by GitHub.
2. [Sign up](https://github.com/join) for a free GitHub user account if you don't already have one. You can ignore the pricing options that appear after signing up; I personally find that the basic account suffices for most, if not all, of my needs as an academic researcher. GitHub will send an email asking you to verify the email address provided -- **make sure to verify your email address before continuing to step 3!**
3. This workshop assumes some familiarity with the command line. 
4. Install Git: Setup instructions will differ depending on your specific operating system (click on the link that applies to you): [Linux or MacOS](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) Users, [WSL for Windows] (https://neurodatasci-course-2020.netlify.app/setup/) (see steps under the header titled "Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)". Please refrain from installing GitHub Desktop or other GitHub Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs). This is in part so that you can first get in the habit of using Git on the command line. There are a couple of [reasons] (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line) for this, one of them being that your Git toolkit is greatly expanded given that the command line is the only place where you can run **all** Git commands.
